# Configuration

Configuration in the akala stack that provides commands for configuration.

You may want to check a live project to see how commands can be written: [see in pm commands](https://github.com/npenin/akala/tree/master/packages/pm/src/commands).
Typescript is preferred, but not mandatory.

# History

The configuration idea came from what [uci provides on openwrt](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci)
